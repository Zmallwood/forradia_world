# Forradia World

This project is a simulation game that generates a dynamic world where creatures, objects, and environmental features interact. The game world is generated with various elements like grass, water, trees, and animals. Players control a hero character that can move around the world, interact with creatures, and explore a procedurally generated environment. The game incorporates keyboard and mouse controls for movement and provides a simple view rendering system to display the world.

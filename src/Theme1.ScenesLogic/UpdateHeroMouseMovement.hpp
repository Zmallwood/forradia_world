    * This function handles the movement of the hero when the left mouse button is clicked.
    * It checks if the left mouse button has been clicked and updates the hero's destination
    * to the hovered tile. It then moves the hero towards the destination if needed,
    * ensuring the hero moves at the correct speed based on the time interval.
    *
    * It handles both horizontal and vertical movement to reach the destination.
    * The movement is processed only after the specified movement time interval has passed.

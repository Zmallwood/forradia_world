     * The WorldViewService handles the rendering of the world, including tiles, objects, creatures, and the hero.
     * It calculates the appropriate positions based on the hero's current position and ensures the world is displayed
     * from the player's perspective. The class uses grid and tile sizes to draw the world in a dynamic and interactive way.
     *
     * Additionally, it manages special rendering effects like visibility (line of sight), hovered tiles, and water tile animations.
